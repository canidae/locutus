daemon
------
* code should be cleaned up, a lot. for starters, create a proper db-layer
* perhaps drop the key-value system in metadata and rather make a fixed class "Track" with "duration", "title", etc.
  would reflect the database a bit better, and would be easier to work with.
* since code is no longer threaded, we can remove mutexes as they serve no purpose.
  note that the database _must_ be cleared, so this should be done each time before running the query.
  this means we don't need the "locutus->database->clear()" after each query too.
* these classes shall die:
  - FileMetadata
  - Metadata
* which will be replaced by these:
  - Album
  - Artist
  - Track
  - Metatrack
  - Metafile
* i'm not fetching release date from id3, am i? check this shit later
