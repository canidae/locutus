* locutus crash if eg. track with tracknumber 1 is removed from the track table and that album got more than 1 tracks. should do something clever here (order by tracknumber desc and seeing if first tracknumber equals rows?)

missing features:
0. album matching
1. saving
2. generate puids
3. "genre" by fetching from audioscrobbler
